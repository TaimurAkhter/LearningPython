# Why basically we need a class?
# What an Object have that we can model with the help of attributes and (or you can say variables)
# And What I do? or What an Object do? that we can model with the help of (functions) or methods in programming using OOP approach.

# See, we don't call these simple variables and functions, we call these attributes and methods
# Why so because these are associated, these are attached with the instructor

# Like name=Taimur and address I have some address. So these name and address are attached to me. 
# These are not free floating variables so, these are attributes that is why we call these attributes and 
# the functions like I Learn, I learn Python these are also attached to me if I am object so that is why they are known as methods not just simple functions that are free floating in your program no write that is why these are known as attributes and methods.

# Everything in Python is an object.
